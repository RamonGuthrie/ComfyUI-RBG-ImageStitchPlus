## Features üöÄ

-   **Multiple Stitching Directions:** Stitch images horizontally, vertically, in compound sequences (e.g., H then V), or in a 2x2 grid.
-   **Proportion Control:** Choose how to handle images of different sizes:
    -   `resize`: Resizes images to match.
    -   `pad`: Adds padding to smaller images to match the largest.
    -   `pad_edge`: Pads with the average color of the image's edge.
    -   `crop`: Crops images to a uniform size before stitching.
-   **Customizable Spacing:** Add spacing between stitched images with a custom width and color.
-   **Background Fill:** Fill transparent areas of the final image with a solid color.
-   **Final Resizing & Anti-Aliasing:**
    -   Resize the final stitched image based on its longer or shorter side.
    -   Apply supersampling for high-quality anti-aliasing.
-   **Clarity Adjustment:** Enhance or soften the midtone contrast of the final image for a punchier or more dreamlike look.
