## An Advanced Image Stitching Node for ComfyUI ‚ú®

This project provides a powerful and flexible image stitching node for ComfyUI, designed to seamlessly combine multiple images into a single canvas. Whether you're creating panoramas, grids, or complex layouts, the RBG Image Stitch Plus node offers the tools you need to get the job done.

## Features üöÄ

-   **Advanced Stitching Directions:** Combine up to three images with multiple layout options:
    -   **Simple:** `right`, `down`, `left`, `up`.
    -   **Compound:** `H_then_V_down`, `H_then_V_up`, `V_then_H_right`, `V_then_H_left`.
    -   **Grid:** `Grid_2x2` for a four-quadrant layout.
-   **Intelligent Proportion Control:** Choose how to handle images of different sizes:
    -   `resize`: Resizes images to match the dimensions required by the layout.
    -   `pad`: Adds padding to smaller images to match the largest image in the relevant dimension.
    -   `pad_edge`: A unique padding mode that analyses the border pixels of an image and uses their average colour for a seamless extension.
    -   `crop`: Crops images to a uniform size. You can control the crop's origin with `crop_position` (`centre`, `top`, `left`, etc.) for precise framing.
-   **Customizable Spacing:** Add a visual separator between stitched images with a custom width and colour.
-   **Background Fill:** Fill transparent areas of the final canvas with a solid colour, perfect for ensuring consistency in your final output.
-   **Advanced Resizing & Anti-Aliasing:**
    -   **Final Resize:** Scale the entire stitched canvas based on its `longer_side` or `shorter_side` to fit specific dimensions.
    -   **Supersampling:** Apply high-quality anti-aliasing by rendering the image at a higher resolution (`supersample_factor`) and then downscaling it.
    -   **Interpolation Control:** Select specific resampling filters (e.g., `lanczos`, `bicubic`, `area`) for both resizing and the final downsample, giving you full control over the final texture and sharpness.
-   **Clarity Adjustment:** Enhance or soften the midtone contrast of the final image. This powerful feature can make an image "pop" with punchy detail or give it a soft, dreamlike feel by adjusting the `clarity_strength`.

## Update: 14/07/2025 - RBG Pad Pro Node üõ†Ô∏è

The `RBGPadPro` node is a powerful and versatile tool designed for advanced image padding and resizing operations. It goes far beyond simple padding by offering intelligent features like aspect ratio correction, edge-aware colour filling, and feathered blending, making it an essential utility for image composition, outpainting preparation, and layout adjustments.

The node takes a primary image and an optional mask, applies a series of transformations based on user-defined parameters, and outputs the modified image and its corresponding mask, ensuring they remain perfectly aligned.

## Feature List üöÄ

- **Multi-Mode Operation:** The node can operate in three main modes:
  - `pad`: Adds padding around the image using a solid colour.
  - `pad_edge`: A smart padding mode that samples the image's border to create a seamless, context-aware fill colour. This is excellent for extending backgrounds.
- **Automatic Aspect Ratio Padding:** Automatically calculates and adds the necessary padding to conform the image to a standard aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, 4:3, 1:1), which is incredibly useful for standardising outputs.
- **Feathered Edges:** Includes a `pad_feathering` option to create a soft, blended transition between the original image and the padded area, avoiding hard lines.
- **Flexible Image Placement:** Provides granular control over the original image's position (center, top, left, etc.) and fine-tuning offsets on the final canvas.
- **Alpha Channel Handling:** Can correctly process RGBA images, either by filling the transparent background with a solid colour or preserving it.
- **Final Resizing:** Allows you to specify a final target resolution, resizing the entire canvas after all padding and cropping operations are complete.
